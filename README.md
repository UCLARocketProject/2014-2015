# UCLA Rocket Project, 2014-2015

UCLA Rocket Project competes annually in the [Intercollegiate Rocket Engineering Competition](http://www.soundingrocket.org/competitions.html), 
hosted by the Experimental Sounding Rocket Association. Our goal this year is to to send a 
10-pound payload atop a custom carbon fiber rocket to 10,000 feet AGL (above ground level)
and then recover it. To dig into the details of our work, see the [wiki](https://github.com/UCLARocketProject/2014-2015/wiki).
