<dl class="section user"><dt>Overview</dt><dd></dd></dl>
<p>RadioHead consists of 2 main sets of classes: Drivers and Managers.</p>
<ul>
<li>Drivers provide low level access to a range of different packet radios and other packetized message transports.</li>
<li>Managers provide high level message sending and receiving facilities for a range of different requirements.</li>
</ul>
<p>Every RadioHead program will have an instance of a Driver to provide access to the data radio or transport, and a Manager that uses that driver to send and receive messages for the application. The programmer is required to instantiate a Driver and a Manager, and to initialise the Manager. Thereafter the facilities of the Manager can be used to send and receive messages.</p>
<p>It is also possible to use a Driver on its own, without a Manager, although this only allows unaddressed, unreliable transport via the Driver's facilities.</p>
<p>In some specialised use cases, it is possible to instantiate more than one Driver and more than one Manager.</p>
<p>A range of different common embedded microprocessor platforms are supported, allowing your project to run on your choice of processor.</p>
<p>Example programs are included to show the main modes of use.</p>
<dl class="section user"><dt>Drivers</dt><dd></dd></dl>

<p>During this combination and redevelopment, we have tried to retain all the processor dependencies and support from the libraries that were contributed by other people. However not all platforms can be tested by us, so if you find that support from some platform has not been successfully migrated, please feel free to fix it and send us a patch.</p>
